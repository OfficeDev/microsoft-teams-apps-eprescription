# E-Prescriptions App Template

Many hospitals and healthcare institutes perform tele-consultation or virtual consults so that doctors can connect with patients remotely. Each appointment results in a prescription being generated. Unlike physical appointments that enable doctors or admins to hand out physical prescriptions to patients, a virtual consult makes this process challenging since admins need to capture prescriptions details from doctors and send these to patients.

This app is designed to automate the process of sending prescriptions to patients in an electronic format without any manual intervention from admins. Doctors can pull up their appointment details and quickly generate an e-prescription for each appointment which lands in a patient’s inbox.

Here is a high-level overview of the app.

Admins can manage e-prescriptions through an admin app including management of doctor records and e-prescription format.

Doctors can view all appointments for a day in a single list view.
For each appointment, an e-prescription can be filled out, previewed and then sent as an email to the patient along with any attachments.
Doctors can also view the generated e-prescriptions.
